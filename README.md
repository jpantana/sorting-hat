* Alphabetized student _cards_ that appear beneathe the jumbotron and the input field
  * cards display student's _house_ at random, and the house colors.
* An _expel_ button added to the bottom or each card allows the user to _expel_ any student, and have that student branded as a deatheater (a new card now displays below)
